# Marcin Kulbicki — Photography Portfolio

This file provides guidance to AI agents working with code in this repository. The project was scaffolded from the **10x Astro Starter** (Astro 6 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + Cloudflare), but **the bundled Supabase backend was removed and replaced with Sanity** (headless CMS) — see `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` § "Post-selection decision" for why. The product goal is a self-manageable photography portfolio: a content layer (Section → Chapter → Photo) behind an existing bespoke editorial front-end with a custom scroll engine (Single/All view modes). See `context/foundation/prd.md` for the full product spec.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Architecture

**Astro 6 app** with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui components, and **Sanity** as the content backend. Deployed to Cloudflare. The bespoke scroll engine and cinematic Single/All modes live as interactive React islands; static content/layout stays in Astro components.

### Rendering mode

Currently `output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs (inherited from the starter). The intended target is a **static public site** (content fetched from Sanity at build time, so the live site has no runtime dependency on the backend) with the Studio route client-rendered — the rendering split is a planned change, not yet applied.

### Content backend (Sanity)

There is **no hand-built auth** — Marcin logs into Sanity Studio (Sanity-managed). The public site is read-only via a public token.

- `src/sanity/env.ts` — public project coordinates (`projectId`, `dataset`, `apiVersion`) from `PUBLIC_SANITY_*` env vars.
- `src/sanity/client.ts` — read-only `@sanity/client` for fetching content + `urlFor()` image-URL builder (on-the-fly responsive transforms, FR-007).
- `src/sanity/schema/{section,chapter,photo}.ts` — the content model. `section` and `chapter` are documents; `photo` (image + alt) is an embedded object. Chapter `photos` are an ordered array; first photo is the hero.
- `sanity.config.ts` (repo root) — Studio config, mounted by `@sanity/astro` at `/admin`.
- The `@sanity/astro` integration in `astro.config.mjs` is **conditional** on `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` being set, so the build stays green before the Sanity project exists.

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (tsconfig paths).
- **Astro components** for static content/layout; **React components** only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind class merging**: use the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional/merged class names. Do not concatenate class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components live in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style variant. Install new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **API routes** (if any are added): use uppercase `GET`, `POST` exports; validate input with zod.
- **Sanity content**: schema lives in `src/sanity/schema/`; query the public site via `sanityClient` (GROQ) and build image URLs with `urlFor()`. Editing is done in Studio (`/admin`) — content is data, not code.
- **React**: no Next.js directives ("use client" etc.). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Services/helpers** go in `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic).
- **Shared types** (entities, DTOs) go in `src/types.ts`.

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Sanity project: `photo-portfolio`, projectId `bp1ecwdp`, dataset `production`. These are **public, non-secret** coordinates baked in as defaults in `src/sanity/env.ts`, `astro.config.mjs`, and `sanity.cli.ts` — no `.env` required to run. Override via `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` / `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` / `PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` if ever needed.
- `sanity.cli.ts` carries the same coordinates for CLI commands (`npx sanity dataset …`, `npx sanity cors …`, `npx sanity deploy`).
- CORS: `http://localhost:4321` (Astro dev) is allowed. Add the Cloudflare production URL before deploying (`npx sanity cors add <url> --credentials`).
- Deploy: Cloudflare Builds (build + deploy on push to `master`). No Sanity env vars needed there — the public coordinates are in code.

## CI

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs **lint only** (ESLint) on every push and PR to master — build + deploy are handled by **Cloudflare Builds**, so the workflow no longer builds (avoids a redundant double-build). Husky pre-commit also runs `eslint --fix` on staged files locally.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 3

Scaffold the project for the stack you picked in Lesson 2, with the **bootstrap chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd)  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  /10x-bootstrapper
```

The PRD chain ships from Lesson 1 and the tech-stack-selector ships from Lesson 2 — both re-included in this lesson so you can fix the PRD or swap the stack mid-flight. `/10x-bootstrapper` is the lesson's main topic. The chain ends here in v1; a future Lesson 4 will set up agent context (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`).

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Bootstrap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-bootstrapper` | You have a hand-off at `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` (written by `/10x-tech-stack-selector`) and you are ready to scaffold the project into the current directory. The skill reads the hand-off, looks up the chosen card in the starter registry, runs its CLI through one of three cwd strategies (scaffold into a temp directory then move files up; scaffold directly into the current directory; clone a starter repo without keeping its git history), preserves `context/` always, sidelines other clashes as `.scaffold` siblings, runs a light pre-scaffold recency check and a deeper post-scaffold audit, and writes a verification log to `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md`. Use AFTER `/10x-tech-stack-selector`. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` | Bundled so you can fix the PRD or swap the stack mid-flight. If `/10x-bootstrapper` surfaces a registry-drift refusal or you change your mind on the starter, re-run `/10x-tech-stack-selector` to regenerate `tech-stack.md` and re-invoke. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-tech-stack-selector` (Lesson 2) writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` with a 4-key frontmatter (`starter_id`, `package_manager`, `project_name`, `hints`) plus a one-paragraph `## Why this stack` body.
- `/10x-bootstrapper` reads that file FULLY (no fallback to conversation history). If it is absent, the skill refuses with a one-sentence redirect to `/10x-tech-stack-selector` and stops — no inline mini-handoff, no standalone-mode in v1.
- The chosen `starter_id` is looked up in `/skills/10x-tech-stack-selector/references/starter-registry.yaml`. The skill consumes that registry; it does not own it. A CI validator (`scripts/validate-starter-registry-sync.mjs`) prevents bootstrapper from referencing a `starter_id` absent from the registry.
- The skill writes `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md` as the audit-trail log for the run. Schema in `/skills/10x-bootstrapper/references/verification-log-schema.md`.

### What bootstrapper captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured (v1)**: scaffold via the chosen card's `cmd_template` (CLI delegation, not inline file generation), three cwd strategies dispatched from `bootstrapper-config.yaml` (`subdir-then-move`, `native-cwd`, `git-clone`), strict conflict policy producing `.scaffold` siblings + always preserving `context/`, two verification slots (light pre-scaffold recency check + deep post-scaffold language-aware audit), severity-tiered audit summary, full verification log on disk.
- **NOT captured in v1 (deliberate)**: `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` generation (deferred to a future Lesson 4 — "Memory Architecture"); per-starter cert-element placement overlays (live with the future agent-context skill, not here); CI workflow files; AI-as-bridge fallback for stacks outside the registry (deferred to v2 — in v1 chain-mode tech-stack-selector already gates on the registry, so the case cannot arise); standalone-mode where the user names a stack inline without a hand-off (deferred to v2); compensation actions for `bootstrapper_confidence: best-effort` or `quality_override: true` (surfaced in conversation but no automated follow-up — that, too, is the future memory-architecture skill's job).

### The conflict policy

When the skill moves files from a temp scaffold directory up into your current working directory, it applies a strict matrix:

- **`context/**`** — anything the scaffold tried to write under `context/` is **dropped**. Your `context/` is the source of truth for the bootstrap chain (PRD, tech-stack hand-off, plans, frames) and is never overwritten.
- **`.gitignore`** — append-merged: your existing lines stay in order, then the scaffold's lines are de-duped against your set and appended with a separator comment. Git's ignore semantics are additive, so combining is safe.
- **`package.json`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, root-level `*.md`** — your existing file wins; the scaffold's copy lands as `<filename>.scaffold` sibling. You can `diff README.md README.md.scaffold` to see what the starter shipped vs what you had.
- **Anything else** — moves silently if no conflict, sidelined as `<filename>.scaffold` if there is one. The matrix never deletes user files.

For the `git-clone` strategy (10x-astro-starter and similar): the cloned `.git/` is deleted before move-up, so the upstream starter's history does not leak into your repo. You initialise your own history afterwards (`git init`).

### Verification log

Every run writes `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md`. Sections:

- **`## Hand-off`** — verbatim copy of the tech-stack.md frontmatter and `## Why this stack` body.
- **`## Pre-scaffold verification`** — recency findings table (npm package version + `time.modified` for JS starters; GitHub `pushed_at` for any starter with a GitHub `docs_url`).
- **`## Scaffold log`** — the resolved CLI invocation, exit code, files moved, conflicts surfaced as `.scaffold` siblings, `.gitignore` handling.
- **`## Post-scaffold audit`** — full per-language audit output (`npm audit --json` for JS, `pip-audit` for Python, `cargo audit` for Rust, etc.). Severity-tiered: CRITICAL and HIGH surfaced inline in chat, MODERATE and LOW log-only. Direct-vs-transitive split where the tool supports it.
- **`## Hints recorded but not acted on`** — every hint from the hand-off bootstrapper read but did not act on in v1. Audit-trail completeness for the future memory-architecture skill.
- **`## Next steps`** — pointer text. v1 names "your project is scaffolded and verified — happy hacking" and flags the future Lesson 4 skill as the next chain link.

The folder (`context/changes/bootstrap-verification/`) deliberately has no `change.md`. Bootstrap runs are one-shot artifacts, not tracked workflow changes — the folder hosts the log and nothing else. Re-runs apply a warn-and-confirm guard before overwriting; the escape hatch is `verification-v2.md` (and so on).

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — input (from Lesson 2)
- `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md` — output (the audit-trail log)
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The post-scaffold audit dispatches by `language_family` against a small lookup table; cohorts whose stack lands in `java`, `php`, `dart`, or a multi-language combination see a "no built-in audit tool for this ecosystem" log line and a recommended external tool, not a fake "0 findings" record.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
